## Description
Hello! Welcome to my weather dashboard. This program uses the fetch function in order to retrieve external information
and render said information back as the current and future forecast. All you have to do is choose a city, and the programming
will do the rest for you! I have built the code from scratch, including HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT.
